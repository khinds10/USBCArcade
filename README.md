# Build

Build black painted shelving to contain the arcade against the wall.

![build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/build/build1.jpg "build1")

Drill holes in the main board that will sit like a square on top of the main desk that contains the buttons.

![build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/build/build2.jpg "build2")

Using the EG Starts guide you can properly space the holes to drill.

![buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/buttons/Buttons2.jpg "buttons")

Underneath the main desk there's a slide out panel with drawer brackets to hold the keyboard and mouse to slide out to use.

The TV is mounted to the wall and surrounded by a wooden frame with a arcade marquee box at the top.  
Measure the TV box frame to just larger than the TV, to enclose it nicely and make it look built in.

# Buttons

The button holes in a typical arcade fighter stick pattern.
Using the EG Starts guide I've wired the buttons accordingly, to a matching stick fighter button arrangement.

![buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/buttons/Buttons1.jpg "buttons")

8 button joystick wired up like so:

K4 K1 R1 L1
K3 K2 R2 L2

It is plug & play in windows and will register as a generic gamepad.

Against the wall, build shelving with red t-moulding edging with black paint, power saw and router with the t-moulding bit.

# Sound

There's a cutout above the TV for the marquee which will hold an additional game decal and 2 stereo speakers.
Use the 3D print surrounds to give the speakers a nice finished look, this avoids having to cut perfect circles.

![sound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/sound/Sound1.jpg "sound1")

Attach the speakers to the 3D Printed surround and attache the surround to the marquee panel to place above the TV.

![sound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/sound/Sound2.jpg "sound2")

Apply decals to center of marquee between the speakers.

# Wiring

Using a USB HDMI Audio Splitter you can wire sound to a small amplifier to power the speakers.

![sound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/USBCArcade/main/build-images/sound/Sound5.jpg "sound5")

The keyboard, mouse, lightgun, controller, and steering wheel all are connected to USB through a hold in the desk, 
these wires will be hidden under the box that mounts the speakers slightly higher than the desk top.

Use coat hooks to nicely wrap the wiring to avoid tangles.
